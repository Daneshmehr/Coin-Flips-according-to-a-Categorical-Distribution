# Project 1
This experiment measures coin flips according to a categorical distribution and graphs the results.  The p-values (probabilities) for getting "heads" in the experiment are stored in `Config.py`.

To run it, first perform the experiment:
```
python Experiment.py
```

The script will create a file named `results.txt` that will look something like this:
```
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 55

```

To perform analysis on the data, do this:
```
python Analysis.py
```
